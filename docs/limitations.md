## AWS Regions & Credentials Limits

- The user needs to use the same AWS region and credentials for both the scanned infrastructure and the S3 bucket where the Terraform state is stored (for example, a Terraform state stored on S3 on us-east-1 for an infrastructure to be scanned on us-west-1 won't work). Think `AWS_PROFILE` for the underlying reason. See the related [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/cloudskiff/driftctl/discussions/130).
- driftctl currently doesn't support multiple aliased providers in a single Terraform state (like a single account but multiple regions). This will be implemented soon.

## Terraform & Providers Support

- Terraform version >= 0.12 is supported
- Terraform AWS provider version >= 3.x is supported
