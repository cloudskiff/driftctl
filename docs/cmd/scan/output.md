## Console

Environment: `DCTL_OUTPUT`

### Usage

```shell
$ driftctl scan
$ driftctl scan --output console://
$ DCTL_OUTPUT=console:// driftctl scan
```

### Structure

```console

  aws_s3_bucket:
    - driftctl-bucket-test-2
Found unmanaged resources:
  aws_s3_bucket:
    - driftctl-bucket-test-3
Found drifted resources:
  - driftctl-bucket-test-1 (aws_s3_bucket):
    ~ Versioning.0.Enabled: false => true

 - 33% coverage
 - 1 covered by IaC
 - 1 not covered by IaC
 - 1 deleted on cloud provider

```

## JSON

```shell
$ driftctl scan --output json:///tmp/result.json # Will output results to /tmp/result.json
$ driftctl scan --output json://result.json # Will output results to ./result.json
$ DCTL_OUTPUT=json://result.json driftctl scan
```
